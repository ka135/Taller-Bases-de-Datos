Títulos: Calibrating quantum gates up to 52 qubits in a superconducting processor
Resumen:  Benchmarking large-scale quantum gates, typically involving multiple native two-qubit and single-qubit gates, is crucial in quantum computing. Global fidelity, encompassing information about inter-gate correlations, offers a comprehensive metric for evaluating and optimizing gate performance, unlike the fidelities of individual local native gates. In this work, utilizing the character-average benchmarking protocol implementable in a shallow circuit, we successfully benchmark gate fidelities up to 52 qubits. Notably, we achieved a fidelity of 63.09% ± 0.23% for a 44-qubit parallel CZ gate. Utilizing the global fidelity of the parallel CZ gate, we explore the correlations among local CZ gates by introducing an inter-gate correlation metric, enabling one to simultaneously quantify crosstalk error when benchmarking gate fidelity. Finally, we apply our methods in gate optimization. By leveraging global fidelity for optimization, we enhance the fidelity of a 6-qubit parallel CZ gate from 87.65% to 92.04% and decrease the gate correlation from 3.53% to 3.22%, compared to local gate fidelity-based optimization. The experimental results align well with our established composite noise model, incorporating depolarizing and ZZ-coupling noises, and provide valuable insight into further study and mitigation of correlated noise. © The Author(s) 2025.

Títulos: Key reconciliation protocol for quantum key distribution
Resumen:  In quantum cryptography, secret communications are delivered through a quantum channel. One of the most important breakthroughs in quantum cryptography has been the quantum key distribution (QKD). This process enables two distant parties to share secure communications based on physical laws. However, eavesdroppers can still interrupt the communication. To overcome this, we propose a different way to detect the presence of Eve through the polynomial interpolation technique. This technique also allows us for key verification. This approach prevents the receiver as well as the intruder from discovering the sender’s fundamental basis. To fully utilize IBM quantum computers’ quantum computing capabilities, this paper attempts to show % error against alpha (strength of eavesdropping) and the impact of noise on the success probability of the desired key bits. Furthermore, the success probability under depolarizing noise is explained for different qubit counts. In the enhanced QKD protocol, using polynomial interpolation for reconciliation shows a 50% probability of successful key generation. This is even when the noise is increased to the maximum capacity. © The Author(s) 2025.

Títulos: Quantum-inspired framework for big data analytics: evaluating the impact of movie trailers and its financial returns
Resumen:  In the context of the growing influence of businesses and marketers on social media platforms, understanding the impact of emotionally charged content on consumer behavior has become increasingly crucial. This study proposes a novel framework, leveraging quantum computing principles, to assess the emotional impact of movie trailers. The framework incorporates big data analytics and utilizes Quantum Walk andQuantum Time Series models to investigate the relationship between a movie trailer's emotional intensity and its financial performance. Unlike sequential problem-solving approach of traditional computing models, Quantum superposition allows exploring multiple options at once. An analysis of 141 movie trailers released after January 1, 2022, revealed a positive correlation between a trailer's emotive score and its financial success. These findings suggest that trailers evoking a stronger emotional response tend to achieve greater box office returns compared to those with a lower emotional impact. This research underscores the pivotal role of emotionally resonant content in shaping consumer behavior and cinematic outcomes. It would offer valuable insights for filmmakers and marketers to optimize audience engagement and financial returns. © The Author(s) 2025.

Títulos: An improved quantum-inspired particle swarm optimisation approach to reduce energy consumption in IoT networks
Resumen: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a pivotal role in modern society, connecting everyday objects to the internet and enabling smart functionalities that enhance efficiency, convenience, and sustainability across multiple sectors. As IoT networks have expanded in scale and complexity, optimising energy consumption has become critical to ensuring their long-term sustainability and cost-effectiveness. This paper introduces quantum-inspired particle swarm optimisation clustering (QIPSOC), an innovative metaheuristic that relies on a novel mathematical formulation (MPMC) and integrates principles from quantum computing and particle swarm optimisation to achieve energy-efficient clustering, balancing network performance constraints and energy consumption. By encoding particles as n-qubit systems and employing quantum-inspired motion through qubit rotations along with an inertial damping factor, QIPSOC enhances solution diversity, mitigates premature convergence to local optima, and guides the exploration of the solution space to achieve significant energy savings, ranging from 17.99 % to over 91 %, depending on the network configuration. These results underscore QIPSOC's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in optimising energy efficiency and performance in IoT networks, making it well-suited for real-world deployment scenarios requiring rapid decision-making. © 2025

Títulos: The Weaponization of Emerging Technologies and Their Impact on Global Risk: A Perspective from the PfPC Emerging Security Challenges Working Group
Resumen: This article examines the shift in international security from traditional threat-centric models to risk-based approaches, focusing on the role of emerging technologies in shaping perceptions and responses. While offering significant benefits, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing have also created new vulnerabilities, particularly when weaponized. Traditional state-centric security frameworks are inadequate in addressing these risks, especially as non-state actors gain access to these powerful technologies. The article categorizes global risks into catastrophic and existential types, exploring how their management demands a shift in risk analysis methods and proactive strategies. It advocates for a multi-stakeholder approach and global cooperation to enhance resilience, with a particular focus on NATO’s adaptive strategies for combatting cyber, cognitive, and hybrid threats. © 2025, Partnership for Peace Consortium of Defense Academies and Security Studies Institutes.

Títulos: An efficient task scheduling algorithm leveraging fuzzy quantum atom search optimizer with innovative migration for cloud computing
Resumen: While the security of virtual machines is the prime issue in the cloud environment. In this paper, an energy and security-aware task scheduling algorithm is proposed. It is based on the atom search optimizer (ASO) and the quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA). This paper uses a load monitoring component to determine under-loaded and overloaded virtual machines. The proposed algorithm (FQASO) combines the ASO with the concepts of quantum computing (i.e., a quantum bit and superposition of states). To increase the search sufficiency of quantum computing, we use a fuzzy coordinate rotation gate in updating individuals. The exploration capabilities of QEA can be used to improve the search capabilities of ASO. An evaluation of the proposed method is divided into two parts. The first part evaluates the FQASO as a meta-heuristic algorithm on eight benchmark functions (including unimodal and multimodal problems) and compares the results with four current algorithms (including ASO, FMPSO, MFGSO, and SCEHO-IPSO). The best fitness metric and the average population fitness metric are used in this section. In unimodal and multimodal problems, the proposed method reduces the objective function by 5.7 and 8.2% on average, respectively. The second part compares FQASO with state-of-the-art methods such as FMPSO, MOWS, ASO, MFGSO, SCEHO-IPSO, SAEA, and GAGWO. FQASO consistently outperforms these methods, saving more than 30.57% of energy while reducing security risks by 53.47%. Compared to SAEA and GAGWO, FQASO shows a 10–25% improvement in makespan and energy efficiency, maintaining lower energy consumption and execution times while achieving competitive security performance. Based on this comprehensive evaluation, FQASO performs significantly better than existing algorithms like SAEA and GAGWO in terms of energy efficiency, makespan, and security management. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

Títulos: QRLaXAI: quantum representation learning and explainable AI
Resumen: As machine learning grows increasingly complex due to big data and deep learning, model explainability has become essential to fostering user trust. Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising field, leveraging quantum computing to enhance classical machine learning methods, particularly through quantum representation learning (QRL). QRL aims to provide more efficient and powerful machine learning capabilities on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, interpreting QRL models poses significant challenges due to the reliance on quantum gate-based parameterized circuits, which, while analogous to classical neural network layers, operate in the quantum domain. To address these challenges, we propose an explainable QRL framework combining a quantum autoencoder (QAE) with a variational quantum classifier (VQC) and incorporating theoretical and empirical explainability for image data. Our dual approach enhances model interpretability by integrating visual explanations via local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and analytical insights using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). These complementary methods provide a deeper understanding of the model’s decision-making process based on prediction outcomes. Experimental evaluations on simulators and superconducting quantum hardware validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for classification tasks, underscoring the importance of explainable representation learning in advancing QML towards more transparent and reliable applications. © The Author(s) 2025.

Títulos: Adaptive neural network for quantum error mitigation
Resumen: Quantum computing holds transformative promise, but its realization is hindered by the inherent susceptibility of quantum computers to errors. Quantum error mitigation has proved to be an enabling way to reduce computational error in present noisy intermediate scale quantum computers. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantum error mitigation by leveraging machine learning, specifically employing adaptive neural networks. With experiment and simulations done on 127-qubit IBM superconducting quantum computer, we were able to develop and train a neural network architecture to dynamically adjust output expectation values based on error characteristics. The model leverages a prior classifier module outcome on simulated quantum circuits with errors, and the antecedent neural network regression module adapts its parameters and response to each error characteristics. Results demonstrate the adaptive neural network’s efficacy in mitigating errors across diverse quantum circuits and noise models, showcasing its potential to surpass traditional error mitigation techniques with an accuracy of 99% using the fully adaptive neural network for quantum error mitigation. This work presents a significant application of classical machine learning methods towards enhancing the robustness and reliability of quantum computations, providing a pathway for the practical realization of quantum computing technologies. © The Author(s) 2025.

Títulos: Application of quantum-inspired tensor networks to optimize federated learning systems
Resumen: Federated learning (FL) has gained significant traction across diverse industries, which allows multiple clients or institutions to enhance model performance and outcomes while preserving data privacy collaboratively. In recent years, tensor networks (TNs) have become important in machine learning because they allow the compact representation of high-dimensional tensors by decomposing them into lower-dimensional components with polynomial complexity. The application of TNs in FL is a natural extension because of its flexible framework for representing and optimizing models. Inspired by quantum computing principles, we have integrated a quantum-inspired tensor network into the FL framework. This framework focuses on a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) tensor network (TN) in a federated setting (FedTN), with data distributed across homogeneous and heterogeneous partitions among clients. Our experiments demonstrate that tensor network-based federated learning can be made practical, as FedTN is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions typically encountered in such settings. Our research assessed the effectiveness and feasibility of comparing quantum-inspired TN and conventional methods, evaluating their performance, and exploring the benefits of incorporating quantum principles in FL settings. Furthermore, we have investigated its performance when training for many local epochs (large E) between the averaging steps. © The Author(s) 2025.

Títulos: Quantum variational rewinding for gravitational wave detection
Resumen: Gravitational waves carry information about far away phenomena which astronomers can use to form a better picture of the universe. Over the past few years, numerous gravitational waves have been detected using a method called matched filtering; however, this approach has two main drawbacks. First, it requires knowledge of the sought-after waveform beforehand. Second, it is infeasible for gravitational wave searches which are precise or cover a long time span. While attempts have been made to use classical machine learning to overcome these difficulties, the usage of quantum machine learning in this context is relatively unexplored. Quantum variational rewinding is a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithm for time series anomaly detection. This work makes the first steps in investigating its potential for gravitational wave detection. Training and testing the algorithm was done without depending on synthetic data. In a noiseless simulated environment, quantum variational rewinding was able to pick out all confirmed gravitational wave signals from the background noise of a detector with perfect accuracy when filtering was applied before hand and was able to do so to a high degree of success without filtering. Anomaly detection with this algorithm was performed with two signals on quantum hardware as a proof of concept. Using Fisher information, both the capacity and the trainability of quantum variational rewinding are described so that future approaches can be compared in these regards. With new gravitational wave detectors under development, even more data will be generated for analysis in the future, compounding the existing bottlenecks in the search pipeline. As such, approaches which help tackle issues with the current approach to gravitational wave analysis are in demand, and the empirical results from this work assert that quantum computing should not be overlooked in this process. © The Author(s) 2025.

Títulos: A new quantum-enhanced approach to AI-driven medical imaging system
Resumen: Medical Imaging Systems (MIS) play a crucial role in modern medicine by providing accurate diagnostic and treatment capabilities. These systems use various physical processes to create images inside the human body for healthcare professionals to identify and address medical conditions. There is a growing interest in integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine from various sources recently. Presently, with improved algorithms and more significant availability of training data, AI can help or even replace some of the tasks that were being performed by medical professionals. Typically, most MIS performance enhancements are achieved by leveraging transistor-based technologies. However, such implementations showcase certain disadvantages: for instance, slow processing speeds, high power consumption, large physical footprints, and restricted switching frequencies, especially in the GHz range. This could limit the effective performance and efficiency of MIS. Quantum computing, in turn, today appears as an alternative, at least for fully digital circuits in MIS; QCA provides advantages related to higher intrinsic switching speeds (up to terahertz) compared with transistor-based technologies, along with an improved throughput owing to its inherent compatibility with pipelining. QCA also has minimum power consumption and a smaller area of circuitry, which makes it amply suitable for establishing frameworks in circuit design for AI applications. The performance requirement in AI is real-time with minimum energy consumption and minimum cost. The ALU, in this regard, forms the basis for processing and computation units within processor systems. The method presented in this work benefits from the merits of QCA for an ALU design featuring low complexity, high performance, minimum power consumption, maximum speed, and reduced area. This approach has been able to successfully integrate the design of adders and multiplexers with that of basic gates to reduce latency and energy consumption with the aim of improving AI in MIS. The development and simulation of the proposed designs are carefully carried out using QCADesigner 2.0.03 software. A comparison of the different structures proposed shows significant improvements in complexity vs. cell count vs. power consumption compared to earlier designs, hence promising quantum computing for the MIS capability development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

Títulos: Determining probability density functions with adiabatic quantum computing
Resumen: The two main approaches to quantum computing are gate-based computation and analog computation, which are polynomially equivalent in terms of complexity, and they are often seen as alternatives to each other. In this work, we present a method for fitting one-dimensional probability distributions as a practical example of how analog and gate-based computation can be used together to perform different tasks within a single algorithm. In particular, we propose a strategy for encoding data within an adiabatic evolution model, which accommodates the fitting of strictly monotonic functions, as it is the cumulative distribution function of a dataset. Subsequently, we use a Trotter-bounded procedure to translate the adiabatic evolution into a quantum circuit in which the evolution time t is identified with the parameters of the circuit. This facilitates computing the probability density as derivative of the cumulative function using parameter shift rules. © The Author(s) 2025.

Títulos: Hybrid classical-quantum multilayer neural networks for monitoring agricultural activities using remote sensing data
Resumen: In recent years, machine learning (ML), supported by the surge in computational power, has been integrated into numerous research domains, providing vital solutions to a broad spectrum of challenges. However, the increasing volume and complexity of data utilized by ML systems have necessitated the exploration of new methods to quicken and refine the precision of existing ML algorithms. The utilization of satellite data in agriculture has grown extensively, providing numerous opportunities to improve different facets of agricultural management and productivity. Interestingly, the volume of data produced increases exponentially with time posing a challenge for classical ML computing methods. Quantum computers, capable of exploiting an exponentially vast quantum state space via quantum superposition and entanglement, are aptly suited to handle such data volumes. Therefore, the integration of classical ML algorithms with quantum computing, known as quantum machine learning (QML), holds significant promise in processing satellite data. In our research, we developed, trained, and evaluated novel hybrid classical-quantum multilayer neural networks, comparing their efficacy with conventional classical networks. We applied QML to two classification tasks, namely the classification of rice and cotton crops using satellite data obtained by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Our results show that integrating quantum neurons into classical multilayer neural networks substantially improves their performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

Títulos: Towards quantum amenable Bayesian networks: classical transformation to facilitate quantum inference
Resumen: Inference in Bayesian networks has been an interesting area of research due to the ability of Bayesian networks in accurately modeling uncertainty in complex use-cases. Performing inference by utilizing quantum computing is possible due to recent works in the area and readily available quantum hardware. However, there are certain limits in terms of qubits when it comes to large-scale Bayesian network inference. We propose a novel segmentation-based approach to perform piece-meal inference on Bayesian networks, where individual segments are run as an independent quantum circuit and act as a prior circuit for downstream segments. In the case of larger and more complex individual segments, we propose Quantum Amenable Classical Transformation (QACT) to channel the likelihoods through a newly added intermediate node, thereby reducing the complexity of the network. Experimental results on various benchmark Bayesian networks demonstrate that the combined use of segmentation and QACT significantly reduces the qubit requirements compared to the existing QBN approach without any statistically significant impact on the inference accuracy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

Títulos: Deep learning-enhanced quantum optimization for integrated job scheduling in container terminals
Resumen: This study explored the challenge of multi-equipment collaborative scheduling and management within container terminals, focusing on essential equipment such as reach stackers, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), quay cranes, and yard cranes. The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) in container handling was modeled using a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. A novel scheduling approach is developed based on the synergistic combination of an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm and quantum computing (QC) (or AI-QC scheduler). This strategy integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to minimize the makespan (total completion time) with accurate coordination of port equipment. Based on operating scenarios in port environments, the proposed AI-QC scheduler offers significant advantages over traditional methods such as first-in-first-out (FIFO), shortest processing time (SPT), and genetic algorithms (GA), particularly in handling stochastic disturbances in processing times. The hybrid technique based on deep learning, quantum computing, and (DRL-QAOA) has self-optimization capabilities, adjusting to changes in market demand in port operations. The AI-QC scheduler can outperform benchmark algorithms in allocating and scheduling port resources, achieving a lower makespan and enhanced operational efficiency across various scenarios. Robust performance indicates optimizing equipment utilization and enhancing terminal throughput, particularly in unpredictable scenarios. Hence, deep-learning AI-driven quantum optimization strategies can improve the competitiveness and efficiency of container terminal operations in a rapidly evolving global market. © 2025

Resumen: Efficient structural reliability analysis methods are of great concern in civil engineering. Although excellent works have be dedicated in the past years for improving the computation efficiency in classical computer, the development of quantum computer has shown new potential to further extend the boundary of computation efficiency. In this paper, an efficient quantum computing based structural reliability assessment method is proposed. Compared with the Monte Carlo method in classical computer, the major advantage of quantum amplitude estimation method is that the computation cost is reduced from ON to ON for the failure probability being O1/N. The present study formulated the reliability problems by means of quantum computing using quantum amplitude estimation. And a simple numerical application example is given to verify the proposed method with comparison to Monte Carlo method. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

Títulos: Flexible hybrid post-quantum bidirectional multi-factor authentication and key agreement framework using ECC and KEM
Resumen: Post-quantum computing becomes a real threat in the coming years, resulting in vulnerable security protocols that rely on traditional public key algorithms. It is not evident to provide protection against it in a cost-efficient manner, especially for Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited capabilities. There is a high variety of IoT applications, some require only short-term security (e.g. agriculture) and others long-term security (e.g. healthcare). In order to provide a unified security approach for such heterogeneity in IoT, we propose a flexible hybrid authentication and key agreement framework for a client–server architecture, which relies both on the classical elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and on a quantum secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM). There are five versions that can be derived from the framework, going from a fully hybrid, and partial hybrid to classical construction. The trade-off between performance and security strength is demonstrated for each of these versions. The overall cost of the protocols is highly reduced thanks to the usage of multifactors in the authentication process, both on the user side by means of biometrics and the device side by means of physically unclonable functions (PUFs). We show that both Kyber and Mc Elience as KEM can offer reasonable performance, depending on the situation. The unified framework offers optimal security protection against the most well-known attacks. © 2024

Títulos: Conversational and generative artificial intelligence and human–chatbot interaction in education and research
Resumen: Artificial intelligence (AI) as a disruptive technology is not new. However, its recent evolution, engineered by technological transformation, big data analytics, and quantum computing, produces conversational and generative AI (CGAI/GenAI) and human-like chatbots that disrupt conventional operations and methods in different fields. This study investigates the scientific landscape of CGAI and human–chatbot interaction/collaboration and evaluates use cases, benefits, challenges, and policy implications for multidisciplinary education and allied industry operations. The publications trend showed that just 4% (n = 75) occurred during 2006–2018, while 2019–2023 experienced astronomical growth (n = 1763 or 96%). The prominent use cases of CGAI (e.g., ChatGPT) for teaching, learning, and research activities occurred in computer science (multidisciplinary and AI; 32%), medical/healthcare (17%), engineering (7%), and business fields (6%). The intellectual structure shows strong collaboration among eminent multidisciplinary sources in business, information systems, and other areas. The thematic structure highlights prominent CGAI use cases, including improved user experience in human–computer interaction, computer programs/code generation, and systems creation. Widespread CGAI usefulness for teachers, researchers, and learners includes syllabi/course content generation, testing aids, and academic writing. The concerns about abuse and misuse (plagiarism, academic integrity, privacy violations) and issues about misinformation, danger of self-diagnoses, and patient privacy in medical/healthcare applications are prominent. Formulating strategies and policies to address potential CGAI challenges in teaching/learning and practice are priorities. Developing discipline-based automatic detection of GenAI contents to check abuse is proposed. In operational/operations research areas, proper CGAI/GenAI integration with modeling and decision support systems requires further studies. © 2024 The Author(s).

Títulos: A note on quantum divide and conquer for minimal string rotation
Resumen: Lexicographically minimal string rotation is a fundamental problem in string processing that has recently garnered significant attention in quantum computing. Near-optimal quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving this problem, utilizing a divide-and-conquer structure. In this note, we show that its quantum query complexity is n⋅2O(log⁡n), improving the prior result of n⋅2(log⁡n) by Akmal and Jin (2022). Notably, this improvement is quasi-polylogarithmic, which is achieved by only logarithmic level-wise optimization using fault-tolerant quantum minimum finding. © 2025 The Author(s)

# Discusión de los Resultados, interpretando los cambios y tendencias observadas.
Los estudios analizados reflejan una creciente convergencia entre la computación cuántica y diversas áreas tecnológicas, incluyendo la optimización, la seguridad de la información, el análisis de datos y la criptografía. Esta tendencia sugiere que la computación cuántica está pasando de ser un campo teórico a una tecnología con aplicaciones prácticas y de impacto en distintas industrias.
Uno de los temas más destacados es la mejora en la calibración y optimización de compuertas cuánticas. En el trabajo sobre calibración de compuertas en procesadores superconductores, se lograron incrementos significativos en la fidelidad de compuertas CZ paralelas, lo que representa un avance en la estabilidad y eficiencia de los sistemas cuánticos a gran escala. Este resultado es relevante para la construcción de computadoras cuánticas escalables y con menor margen de error.
En el campo de la criptografía cuántica, el protocolo mejorado de reconciliación de claves basado en interpolación polinómica demuestra un avance en la seguridad de la distribución cuántica de claves (QKD). La resistencia a ataques, incluso en presencia de ruido, refuerza la aplicabilidad de estos protocolos en entornos reales, donde la seguridad de la información es un factor crítico.
Por otro lado, el uso de la computación cuántica en el análisis de datos de redes sociales y el impacto de contenido visual en la toma de decisiones económicas sugiere una nueva área de aplicación: la intersección entre inteligencia artificial y computación cuántica para la predicción y optimización del comportamiento del consumidor. La correlación positiva encontrada entre la intensidad emocional de los tráilers de películas y su rendimiento financiero valida la utilización de enfoques cuánticos para mejorar la toma de decisiones en marketing y entretenimiento.
Finalmente, la aplicación de la computación cuántica en la optimización del consumo energético en redes de IoT resalta su impacto en la sostenibilidad tecnológica. El enfoque de optimización basado en enjambres de partículas cuánticas (QIPSOC) ha demostrado una mejora significativa en la eficiencia energética de estas redes, lo que abre la puerta a su aplicación en sistemas inteligentes y ciudades conectadas.
Tendencias Observadas
Optimización de Hardware Cuántico: Mejoras en la calibración y reducción de errores en compuertas cuánticas permiten el desarrollo de hardware más fiable.
Seguridad Cuántica Avanzada: Protocolos resistentes a ruido y métodos de distribución de claves cuánticas fortalecen la criptografía cuántica.
Computación Cuántica en Big Data: Aplicación en análisis de datos financieros y comportamiento del consumidor.

Estos resultados muestran una evolución hacia aplicaciones más concretas y prácticas de la computación cuántica, consolidándola como una tecnología fundamental para el futuro.
# Conclusiones y recomendaciones para futuras investigaciones.
El estudio de calibración de puertas cuánticas hasta 52 qubits en un procesador superconductivo ha permitido evaluar el desempeño de grandes puertas cuánticas a través de la fidelidad global. Se observó que la fidelidad de una puerta CZ paralela de 44 qubits alcanzó el 63.09% ± 0.23%, lo que indica la presencia de errores de correlación inter-puerta. Sin embargo, al optimizar la fidelidad global, la fidelidad de una puerta CZ de 6 qubits se incrementó del 87.65% al 92.04%, con una reducción en la correlación de la puerta del 3.53% al 3.22%. Estos resultados sugieren que la optimización basada en fidelidad global es más efectiva que la basada en fidelidad local para reducir errores de crosstalk.
En el caso del protocolo de reconciliación de claves para distribución cuántica de claves (QKD), se verificó que la interpolación polinómica es una herramienta viable para la detección de intrusos y la validación de claves. A pesar del aumento de ruido, el protocolo demostró una probabilidad del 50% de generar claves exitosas, lo que resalta su resistencia a condiciones adversas.
El análisis del impacto de los tráilers de películas utilizando computación cuántica y big data reveló que la intensidad emocional de un tráiler se correlaciona positivamente con su éxito financiero. Este hallazgo subraya la importancia de las emociones en la respuesta del consumidor y sugiere que las estrategias de marketing podrían beneficiarse de modelos cuánticos para la optimización de contenido publicitario.
En la optimización del consumo energético en redes IoT mediante el algoritmo QIPSOC, se lograron ahorros de energía entre el 17.99% y el 91%, dependiendo de la configuración de la red. Esto demuestra que la integración de principios cuánticos con metaheurísticas clásicas permite mejorar significativamente la eficiencia energética y el rendimiento en redes de IoT.
Los resultados obtenidos en estos estudios evidencian el potencial de la computación cuántica en diversas áreas, desde la optimización de puertas cuánticas hasta la aplicación en criptografía, análisis de datos y eficiencia energética. Se destacan las siguientes conclusiones:
Optimización de Puertas Cuánticas: La fidelidad global permite mejorar el rendimiento de las puertas cuánticas al reducir los errores de crosstalk. Futuras investigaciones podrían explorar modelos más precisos para la mitigación del ruido y mejorar la escalabilidad de la calibración en sistemas cuánticos de mayor tamaño.
Criptografía Cuántica: La interpolación polinómica demostró ser efectiva en la validación de claves. Sin embargo, futuros estudios deberían evaluar su seguridad ante diferentes tipos de ataques y su implementación en hardware cuántico real.
Big Data y Computación Cuántica: La aplicación de modelos cuánticos en el análisis de contenido emocional en redes sociales y publicidad sugiere un nuevo enfoque para la toma de decisiones en marketing. Se recomienda explorar el impacto de otros factores, como la duración del tráiler y su contexto cultural.
